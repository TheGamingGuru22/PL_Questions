**Author: John Mulhern** \
*Discord ID: John M*

# **Assignment:**
- Find a question (or a set of related questions) on the topic of Programming Languages. Feel free to discus with your instructor. As always, the questions must be interesting.

- Use an LLM to explore the question. Do not stop after the first question but rather explore the landscape that opens in front of you once you start on your journey. Pay attention to the following.

    - How has the question been addressed in the past? What are the historical developments?

    - Which subfields of PL contributed to investigating the question?

    - How did these subfields influence each other?

    - Who are the influential researchers who left their mark on the field?

    - What are some of the most influential research articles, books, software, etc?

#
### **My Question:**

The idea I chose to investigate for this assignment was how have programming languages improved upon each other over the course of several iterations? Taking in batches of four to five programming languages that came out roughly around the same time as each other, I wanted to ask a LLM, in this case ChatGPT 3.5, how has each iteration of programming languages improved upon each other, and why those improvements were deemed necessary or desired. For each iteration, I asked a similar question providing a handful of other programming languages, asking about how the new iterations of programming languages improved upon the previous iterations. All in all, my version of this assignment covers descriptions of twenty-seven different programming languages, the purpose behind their development, and how the next generation of programming languages improved upon the previous. Interestingly enough, a majority of improvements came about due to a desire for easier readability, error detectability, and functionality for those looking to better understand code without a very in-depth scientific background. Other grounds for desired upgrades appeared in the economic sector, as businesses desired programs and systems that allowed for easier data collection, moderation, and manipulation.


# Back & Forth with ChatGPT 3.5

They represent a move toward multi-paradigm programming and greater accessibility for developers at different skill levels, with a particular focus on productivity, interoperability, and simplifying complex programming tasks.


## Fantastic. Now, could you inform me of the development process of programming languages such as Closure, Dart, Go, Rust, and Swift, and how this iteration of programming languages improved on the previous generation of programming languages you just informed me about?

### ChatGPT said:
Certainly! Let's explore the development of the next set of programming languages: Clojure, Dart, Go, Rust, and Swift, and how they brought about innovations and improvements compared to their predecessors, like Scala, C#, Groovy, and others.

### 1. Clojure (2007)
Creation: Clojure was created by Rich Hickey and first released in 2007. It is a modern, functional, and dynamic dialect of Lisp designed to run on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Its primary focus is on immutability, concurrency, and functional programming.

- Purpose:
    - Concurrency and Immutability: Clojure was designed to address the increasing need for handling concurrent programming in multi-core systems. By emphasizing immutable data structures and functional programming, Clojure simplifies reasoning about concurrent applications.
    - Lisp Dialect: Clojure is a descendant of Lisp, inheriting Lisp’s macro system and syntax but adding modern features to integrate smoothly with Java and modern platforms.

- Improvements:
    - Immutable Data Structures: Unlike Groovy, Scala, or Java, Clojure emphasizes immutability by default. This helps reduce side effects and makes concurrent programming safer and easier.
    - Simplicity and Macros: Clojure’s macro system offers powerful ways to extend the language, and its minimalistic Lisp syntax (based on s-expressions) provides a more flexible foundation for programming.
    - Concurrency Support: Clojure introduced a software transactional memory (STM) system and agents, which simplifies the complexities of concurrent programming, making it easier to develop reliable, multi-threaded applications.

### 2. Dart (2011)
Creation: Dart was developed by Google and unveiled in 2011. It was designed as a client-optimized language for fast, scalable web and mobile applications, addressing some limitations of JavaScript in modern web development.

- Purpose:
    - Client-Side Web Development: Dart was intended to replace or complement JavaScript for building more maintainable and performant web applications. It has since evolved to support mobile app development through the Flutter framework.
    - JavaScript Replacement: Google developed Dart as a response to perceived limitations in JavaScript, such as performance, scalability, and lack of strong typing.

- Improvements:
    - Faster and More Scalable Web Development: Dart was designed to improve both the development experience and the performance of large-scale web applications compared to JavaScript. It supports both ahead-of-time (AOT) and just-in-time (JIT) compilation for performance optimization.
    - Strong Typing and Object-Oriented: Unlike JavaScript, Dart is a strongly typed language, which aids in early error detection and makes large-scale application development more robust.
    - Flutter Integration: Dart’s popularity skyrocketed with the advent of Flutter, Google’s mobile UI framework, which allows developers to write cross-platform apps from a single codebase.

### 3. Go (2009)
Creation: Go, also known as Golang, was created at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson in 2009. It was developed to address the inefficiencies in existing systems programming languages (primarily C and C++) while maintaining simplicity and high performance.

- Purpose:
    - Systems Programming and Web Services: Go was designed as a highly efficient language for building large-scale, concurrent systems, cloud services, and modern distributed applications.
    - Simple, Performant, and Concurrency-Oriented: Go was aimed at offering C-like performance with an emphasis on easy-to-understand concurrency through goroutines (lightweight threads) and channels.

- Improvements:
    - Concurrency: Go's goroutines and channels provide a simple, lightweight, and highly efficient mechanism for handling concurrent programming, which is much easier than traditional thread management in languages like C++, Java, or even Scala.
    - Simplicity: Go emphasizes simplicity in both syntax and usage, stripping away complex features like inheritance and templates from C++, which makes it easy to learn and maintain compared to other system programming languages.
    - Memory Management: Go includes garbage collection, removing manual memory management found in languages like C and C++. This balances performance with developer productivity.

### 4. Rust (2010)
Creation: Rust was developed by Mozilla, with Graydon Hoare as the original designer, and first appeared in 2010. It was created to provide a modern systems programming language focused on safety, performance, and concurrency, addressing some of the memory management issues found in languages like C and C++.

- Purpose:
    - Memory Safety and Systems Programming: Rust was designed to prevent common programming errors such as memory leaks, null pointer dereferencing, and data races while maintaining high performance and control over system resources.
    - Concurrency without Data Races: Rust places a heavy emphasis on thread safety, offering guarantees at compile-time that eliminate data races, a common issue in concurrent programming.

- Improvements:
    - Ownership System: Rust’s ownership and borrowing system ensures memory safety without needing a garbage collector, offering the performance of C/C++ while preventing common memory-related bugs.
    - Zero-Cost Abstractions: Rust provides high-level abstractions without sacrificing performance, a key improvement over languages like Go or C++.
    - Concurrency Safety: Rust guarantees memory safety across concurrent threads, preventing data races at compile time, which is a significant improvement over languages like C++, Go, and Java that can be prone to concurrency-related bugs.

### 5. Swift (2014)
Creation: Swift was developed by Apple, with Chris Lattner leading the effort, and first released in 2014. It was designed to replace Objective-C as the main programming language for building applications across Apple’s platforms (iOS, macOS, watchOS, etc.).

- Purpose:
    - Modern Application Development: Swift was designed to simplify app development for Apple’s ecosystem, offering improved syntax, safety features, and performance compared to Objective-C.
    - Safer and More Efficient: Swift addresses many of the complexities and safety issues inherent in Objective-C, providing safer memory management, type safety, and modern syntax features.

- Improvements:
    - Memory Safety and Type Safety: Swift includes automatic reference counting (ARC) for memory management, eliminating the need for manual memory management in Objective-C. It also provides strong type safety, which helps catch errors at compile time.
    - Readability and Performance: Swift is designed to be concise and easy to read, with modern features like optionals, closures, and generics. It also provides performance improvements compared to Objective-C by eliminating runtime overhead.
